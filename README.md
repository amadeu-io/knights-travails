# Knight Travails

### About ðŸ“–

Solution to the 9th assignment in the JavaScript chapter in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails).

### Description ðŸ“š

This repo contains the function `knightMoves`, which shows the shortest way possible for a knight to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

### Learning ðŸŒ±

The point of this project is using a tree data structure on a real world problem. By organizing all possible moves a knight can make in a data tree, we can easily find the shortest path to a leaf node to effectively find the answer. It's also handy because we can recycle the methods we built previously on [Binary Search Trees](https://github.com/nightrunner4/binary-search-trees).
